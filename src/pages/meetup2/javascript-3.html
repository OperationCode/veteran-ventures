	//Declaration: 	creating space to store a piece of information
	//Syntax:		var leftOperandName;
	var x;
		
	//This statement is an assignment.: 
	//Assignment: 	saving a piece of data to a variable
	//Syntax:  		leftOperandName = rightOperandName;
	x = 1;
	
	//The variable x now contains the value 1. Printing it to the console reflects that.

	//What happens if you declare a variable but dont assign anything and log it?
	var y;	
	console.log(y);
