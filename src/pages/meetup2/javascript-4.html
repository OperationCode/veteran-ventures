	// This statement is an expression
	// Expression: 	some pieces of data that evaluate to some new piece of data
	// Syntax:		data operator data;
	1 + 2;

	// This statement assigns the result of an expression to a newly declared variable: 
	// Assignment: 	saving a piece of data to a variable
	// Syntax:  	var leftOperandName = data operator data;
	var x = 1 + 2;
	
	// The variable x now contains the value 3.
	console.log(x);
	
	// These statements assign numbers to variables a and b.
	// Those are then used in an expression.
	// The result of the expression is assigned to c.

	//The expression on the right results in true or false depending on the value of the variables.
